# Pre-installation Steps

- STEAM version of Starfield (No GamePass/Microsoft Support). DO NOT ASK FOR MY HELP WITH A PIRATED VERSION
- Version 1.13.61 ( Or whatever the one is called when the DLC came out lmao ) of Starfield ( Shattered Space Update ). PLEASE TURN OFF AUTOMATIC UPDATES for your sake and do NOT ever update until a newer version of Starfield NASAPUNK releases.
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14.40.33810.0 (Most PC’s have this but please make sure)
- Fresh Save (even V4 users) (NG+ does NOT count)
- Language set to English otherwise none of the text replacement mods will work. Check for translations on NexusMods

# Page File and Shader Cache

- You will need to manually increase your page file as well as increase the size of your shader cache in order to avoid performance issues, even if you have a monster PC.
- To increase your page file, press Windows+R and enter **systempropertiesadvanced** into it. Under "Performance", click "Settings..." and swap to the Advanced tab. Here you want to click "Change" under virtual memory.
- Uncheck "Automatically manage..." and select your fastest SSD in the list of drives. Check "Custom Size" and set **Initial Size to 20480** and set **Maximum Size to 40000**. Now press "Set" and then APPLY before restarting your PC.
- Increase the shader cache size via Nvidia Control Panel to at least **10GB**. For AMD users, similar steps might apply.

## What is Wabbajack?
Wabbajack is an automated modlist installer. It will replicate my modlist and all it’s configurations with a portable version of Mod Organizer 2 on your PC. If you have premium on Nexus Mods, then this process is very easy and in just a few clicks, you can be downloading hundreds of mods at once. If you don’t have premium, it’s going to have you click through each mod to download but it’ll guide you exactly on which one to click. After that, it’ll still do all the load order/plugin configuration for you.

- Make sure Starfield is installed in the SAME drive you’re installing the modlist on.
- If you have any Creation Store mods, please uninstall ALL of them
- TURN OFF Automatic Updates for Starfield
- If you’ve modded Starfield at launch and/or with Vortex Mod Manager, you probably definitely have lingering mods that will cause problems. Please uninstall Starfield through Steam, double check that both Documents\My Games\Starfield and steamapps\common\Starfield folders are deleted, then re-install
- I am not joking. This is NOT Skyrim. Having just 1 mod that’s not supposed to be there can make the entire modlist break.

## Wabbajack install

- 1 Before you go through this install, please be aware that this List is in Beta (since September 15).
- 2 Create the following three folders at the root of your drive (e.g., C:, D:, or whichever drive you’re using). Star Field NASAPUNK Install / Starfield NASAPUNK Downloads and Compiler.
- 3 Download Starfield NASAPUNK 0.5.wabbajack and put it inside the COMPILER folder. Later on the Version might Change ofc. The Wabbajack File is currently only available on Discord. Later on also Nexus and Wabbajack itself.
- 4 Download the latest version of Wabbajack.exe from [here](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and put it inside the WABBAJACK folder.
- 5 In the WABBAJACK folder, run Wabbajack.exe to install it.
- 6 After the install finishes, run Wabbajack.exe again to open it.
- 7 Click the gear icon (settings) on the top left, then logon to Nexus Mods. Even if you’re already logged in, log out and log back in. Trust me
- 8 Go back to the Wabbajack Main Menu and select Install From Disk
- 9 Match everything to this (remember the drive letter like K, C, etc should match yours, not mine): Target Modlist = Wabbajack File you got from Nexus or Discord. Modlist Installation will be your Install Folder you setup and Downloads will be the Downloads Folder you setup.
- 10 Start the install. if you don’t have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack makes you click through each mod. if you do have Nexus Premium, then Wabbajack downloads each mod automatically for you.
- 11 Wait for the install to finish. I advise you to read the NASAPUNK Documentation to know what awaits you! NASAPUNK Documentation here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQINWjsR9EOJ1IiGA_gFaJwR1ZPbHbq_S6uedBOXDbjCafcjnkT4HC-2EPHDE9Dj2wNB4dXGRhrl7vx/pub

# Note: If you encounter any installation errors, please read what the error is on the left-hand side and consult the FAQ, or take a picture of it and send it to the help section of my Discord.

## Post Installation Steps

- 1 Do not use BethPie, it will overwrite the Custom Settings! Never ever use it.
- 2 Launch ModOrganizer.exe in the Starfield NASAPUNK Install Folder. You will get a popup asking about nxm links. Click Yes.
- 3 Note: If ModOrganizer.exe is failing to open or is missing, then simply refer to the solutions in my F.A.Q.
- 4 Make sure if you launch the Game to always use the Launch Button in the top right called SFSE Starfield. Without it everything breaks.

## In Game Settings

- 1 Launch the game by selecting SFSE Starfield at the top right side and clicking Run. Do not panic if this takes awhile. It is normal for it to take a few minutes for the first time. If this is a fresh install of Starfield, then I recommend you restart your game after reaching the main menu. Otherwise your mods won’t properly load in.
- 2 After starting a new game, you will be asked to Skip the Intro and jump to Char Creation. Do not click anythig but the Dialogue in that Sequence. 
- 3 You can skip the Intro to get into Character Creation directly. After creating your character, you must save and then fully restart your game. Otherwise you will have sound, animation, and texture issues.
- 4 WARNING WARNING: Do not skip to the Constellation Lodge, it can be problematic and cause random Crashes from going forward. You will get NO Support if you skip to the LODGE!

Many of your graphics settings have probably reset. There are some graphics setting you should configure regardless of your the specs of your PC:
- Upscaling – OFF (YOU WILL HAVE CRASHES WITH IT ON) ( Optional, we dont know if this still applies after the DLC Update )
- Framegen – OFF (YOU WILL HAVE CRASHES WITH IT ON) ( Optional, we dont know if this still applies after the DLC Update )
- Motion Blur – OFF
- Film Grain – OFF
- VSync – OFF
- Show Damage Numbers – OFF (for immersion)
- Dialogue and General Subtitles – ON (under Accessibility)
- Music – ON (under Audio Settings)
- Normal Difficulty (under Gameplay Options)
- Mentioning it one more time. Disable automatic updates for Starfield on Steam.
- Note: If you are for some reason trying to load the modlist into an existing save, then I will not offer further support to you beyond what’s in this page here.
- After that is the final step of deleting everything in your Overwrite directory in Mod Organizer 2 (at the bottom of your modlist). If this is empty. You may skip this step.

# You are done and now ready to launch the game.
