# VENTURE FORTH

## "The Essentials, Plus Sloot."

## Preamble

_Venture Forth_ is a small, proof-of-concept Quality of Life improvement for _Baldur's Gate 3_ which also includes the latest nude body overhauls and a selection of skimpy outfits.

#### More Information

If you are interested in examining a complete list of the mods in this modlist, [go here.](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/venture-forth)

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory, it must be created before continuing. _Nexus Free_ is probably adequate because the modlist is minimal in size.

## Installation

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update, open the Properties window of _Baldur's Gate 3_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory. (D:\ for example.)

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. The list will not install or run properly otherwise. Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ must be fully uninstalled due to technical limitations. Unfortunately, _Windows Defender_ is the only recommended antimalware solution one should use with _Wabbajack._
 
##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right. It will toggle over to "logged in" when successful.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Venture Forth_ will not work with anything but a legitimate copy of _Baldur's Gate 3_ purchased on _Steam._ If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **Asking for help with pirated copies of the game will get you banned from Discord Support.**

## Post-Installation

### Registering the Mods with _BG3 Mod Manager_

Unfortunately, while _Wabbajack_ can handle the installation of all the mods necessary for this modlist, it cannot yet automatically register configuration changes necessary to make them work in game. To accomplish this yourself, you need to launch "BG3 Mod Manager" from the dropdown menu. Once it is open, select "Import Order From File..." from the "File" menu. The BG3MM directory will appear, double click on the **bottom most** mod configuration (the `.tsv` file). You will receive an error that mods are missing, this is a false flag because of MO2's VFS file structure. You must click "Remove All Missing" here. Don't worry -- _ModFixer_ is still in the list as an override. Once that is done, select "Export Order to Game" from the "File" menu and the mods will all be registered to your game.

### Launching the Modlist

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **BG3** entry in the drop-down menu. 

Please remember that if for some reason you launch _Baldur's Gate 3_ outside of _MO2_, all of the mods will become unregistered and you must repeat the steps in the Registering Mods paragraph.

## Updating the Modlist

Download the modlist's `.wabbajack` file again and specify the same directories. _Wabbajack_ will only update what has changed, it will not repeat the entire installation. 

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Venture Forth_ folder.
