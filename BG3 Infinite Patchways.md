### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory, it must be created before continuing. Nexus Premium would be good because its over 600 Mods. Its possibile being free yes, but you have to click quite abit.

## Installation

Nuke Baldurs Gate 3 ( Delete everything ) : Uninstall the game completely, delete anything left of the install folder (e.g. d:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3), and delete the folder at %appdata%\Local\Larian Studios. This is to ensure no errant files are leftover from previous playthroughs and is especially important for preventing data mismatches that will block multiplayer. Nuking everything improves the odds that Listo works as expected by providing a blank slate to build up from. Otherwise some files like an unwanted modsettings.lsx or gustavdev could interfere with Listo. This is especially true now with Mod.io integration and Larian's official mod manager services.

Also ensure that your new Baldur's Gate 3 is in a steam folder on the base of your drive (IE: C:/Steam/.../BaldursGate3), Wabbajack/MO2 might struggle if it is in a default Steam location like C:/program files(86)/Steam/.../BG3.

Launch the game (vanilla) once to regenerate all of the folders/paths that MO2 needs.

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update, open the Properties window of _Baldur's Gate 3_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory. (D:\ for example.)

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. The list will not install or run properly otherwise. Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ must be fully uninstalled due to technical limitations. Unfortunately, _Windows Defender_ is the only recommended antimalware solution one should use with _Wabbajack._
 
##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right. It will toggle over to "logged in" when successful.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Infinite Pathways_ will not work with anything but a legitimate copy of _Baldur's Gate 3_ purchased on _Steam._ If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **Asking for help with pirated copies of the game will get you banned from Discord Support.**

## Post-Installation

Keep in Mind if you dont like Certain NPC Overhauls or Choices that were made, mostly you can disable them in Mod Organizer 2. The Sex Framework is optional and doesnt add much Content anyway.

## Important Information

In Mo2, there is a Mod at the very Bottom called Output Overwrite. Please copy its contents into the Mo2 overwrite at the very bottom thats written in red. Overwrite everything if asked.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd7e1c0-6ab1-46ce-b8a1-0e5abfa465c1) 

You can rightclick the Output and click Open in Explorer, and then copy the Contents into the red overwrite, also by rightclicking it and Opening it in the Explorer.

There is 2 Undead Races bcs of different Bodies.

Certain Origins Characters have wrong Body Colors in Character Creation its fixed ingame.

Choose whatever Difficulty you want, i reccomend Custom, Balanced Settings and Activate Honour Ruleset. Rest is on you.

Certain Classes like Wizard and others, only get the new Sublcasses on Level 2. But dont worry you can respec ingame easily via Respec Spell.

Dont open the Mod Manage ingame, only the Mod Configuration Menu if you wanna adjust Settings.


### Launching the Modlist

Launch _ModOrganizer.exe_ from the directory in which you installed the list. Launch the game from the **BG3** entry in the drop-down menu. 

Please remember that if for some reason you launch _Baldur's Gate 3_ outside of _MO2_, all of the mods will become unregistered and you must repeat the steps in the Registering Mods paragraph.

## Updating the Modlist

Download the modlist's `.wabbajack` file again and specify the same directories. _Wabbajack_ will only update what has changed, it will not repeat the entire installation. 

## Removing the Modlist

You can just remove the _Infinite Pathways_ folder.
