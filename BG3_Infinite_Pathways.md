#### More Information

### Requirements

- [Nexus Account](https://nexusmods.com/)

This account is mandatory, it must be created before continuing. Nexus Premium would be good because its over 600 Mods. Its possibile being free yes, but you have to click quite abit.

## Installation

Nuke Baldurs Gate 3 ( Delete everything ) : Uninstall the game completely, delete anything left of the install folder (e.g. d:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3), and delete the folder at %appdata%\Local\Larian Studios. This is to ensure no errant files are leftover from previous playthroughs and is especially important for preventing data mismatches that will block multiplayer. Nuking everything improves the odds that the List works as expected by providing a blank slate to build up from. Otherwise some files like an unwanted modsettings.lsx or gustavdev could interfere with the List. This is especially true now with Mod.io integration and Larian's official mod manager services.

Also ensure that your new Baldur's Gate 3 is in a steam folder on the base of your drive (IE: C:/Steam/.../BaldursGate3), Wabbajack/MO2 might struggle if it is in a default Steam location like C:/program files(86)/Steam/.../BG3.

Launch the game (vanilla) once to regenerate all of the folders/paths that MO2 needs.

## Installing Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET

This is kinda important to have if you wanna do the Stuff todo the Stuff!

- Install Visual C++ x64. https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
- Install .NET Runtime 8.X.X Desktop x64. https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0
- Install .NET 6.0 Runtime Desktop x64. https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.30-windows-x64-installer

###  Installing Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package

The _Microsoft Visual C++_ redistributable package is required for _Mod Organizer 2_ and you can download it from _Microsoft._ Download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" [here](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

###  Steam Config

**Change Steam's Update Behavior**

To ensure that _Steam_ does not automatically update, open the Properties window of _Baldur's Gate 3_ in _Steam_, navigate to the Updates tab and change Automatic updates to _Only update this game when I launch it_.

**Do Not Use Any Part of This List in a Protected Folder**

This includes `Program Files,` `Program Files (x86)`, `Downloads`, `Documents`, the `Desktop` or any other folders that _Windows_ considers "Protected" (essential to the operating system). If the _Wabbajack_ folder, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ folder, the _Steam_ folder, the modlist folder or the downloads folder are in any of these directories, the modlist will not function properly. Relocate offending folders to a non-Protected location such as the root directory. (D:\ for example.)

**Make Exceptions for Anti-Malware Programs**

Exclude antivirus and anti-malware programs from monitoring three directories: those containing the _Wabbajack_ app, the _Baldur's Gate 3_ game folder, and the directory in which you wish to install the modlist. The list will not install or run properly otherwise. Particularly intrusive malware solutions such as _Bitdefender_ and _Webroot_ must be fully uninstalled due to technical limitations. Unfortunately, _Windows Defender_ is the only recommended antimalware solution one should use with _Wabbajack._
 
##  Using Wabbajack

Login to _Nexus_ with the _Wabbajack_ app. This login can be found by clicking the **GEAR** icon in the top right. It will toggle over to "logged in" when successful.

##  Problems with Wabbajack

There are a lot of different scenarios where _Wabbajack_ will produce an error. Re-run _Wabbajack_ before seeking assistance. _Wabbajack_ will only download and reinstall the bare minimum necessary to get the modlist working. 

**Could not download x:**

Some Internet providers have difficulty accessing the servers which host the files comprising the list. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) with a terminus set to the United States. Free options include _ProtonVPN_ and _Cloudflare WARP._ If a download gets interrupted, delete all corrupt local copies before trying again.

**Wabbajack could not find my game folder:**

_Infinite Pathways_ will not work with anything but a legitimate copy of _Baldur's Gate 3_ purchased on _Steam._ If you own the game on _Steam,_ go back to the Installation step. If this still doesn't work, ensure that you are not running Wabbajack as an Administrator. **Asking for help with pirated copies of the game will get you banned from Discord Support.**

## Launching the Modlist 

( IF it shows you Vanilla Game on Boot Up: ( Only do this if the Modlist doesnt work initially by starting it via DX11 or Vulkan, for some the List works from the get go. It works if you see different Loading Screen on booting the Game up. )

1. Open Mod Manager Ingame in the Bg3 Client. ( Main Menu )
2. Install the first mod in there ( Should be ImpUi )
3. Then uninstall the Imp UI Mod again.
4. Close the game
5. Then relaunch through Mo2 again via the DX11 or Vulkan Shortcut.
6. When you Freeze at 100% Loading, wait for 2-3 Minutes. If it doesnt start, restart Game and try again. Dont click anything while the Main Menu is loading.
7. If you followed the Overwrite Instructions above you will have a Checkmark in the Picture down below. If its unchecked you missed the Overwrite Copy Part. Remember, after every Update you need to redo the Overwrite Step.

## Post-Installation

Keep in Mind if you dont like Certain NPC Overhauls or Choices that were made, mostly you can disable them in Mod Organizer 2. The Sex Framework is optional and doesnt add much Content anyway.

## Important Information

WARNING: Everytime you update the Modlist, save your Savegames beforehand so they dont get deleted.

In Mo2, there is a Mod at the very Bottom called Overwrite Output. Please copy its contents inside the Folder into the Mo2 overwrite at the very bottom thats written in red. Overwrite everything if asked.

Do not copy the Folder OVERWRITE but the Contents inside of it, all these Files and Folders go into the OVERWRITE at the very bottom.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2cd7e1c0-6ab1-46ce-b8a1-0e5abfa465c1) 

You can rightclick the Output and click Open in Explorer, and then copy the Contents into the red overwrite, also by rightclicking it and Opening it in the Explorer.

Important Info: You can get your Auto Sorting Bags when you Crouch and grab them from the Tutorial Chest Summon

Info: Certain Origins Characters have wrong Body Colors in Character Creation its fixed ingame.

Choose whatever Difficulty you want, i reccomend Custom, Balanced Settings and Activate Honour Ruleset. Rest is on you.

Info : Dont open the Mod Manager ingame, only the Mod Configuration Menu if you wanna adjust Settings. Unless you follow the Optional Way described below.

Important Info: Some Classes work until Level 20, other only unti Level 12. I advice to Multiclass then.
