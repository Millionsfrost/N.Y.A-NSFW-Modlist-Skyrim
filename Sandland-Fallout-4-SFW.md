## Accounts

In terms of accounts, you will need a Nexus Account; Premium would be best, as it speeds up the download process, but it is not required.


Loveslab Account for manual downloads.

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6Fg9axI.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Fg9axI.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This package is a must as MO2 needs it - you may already have it if you've used MO2 before. If you do not have it, you want to download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017, and 2019".
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Install .NET 7.0 Desktop Runtime (v7.0.15) - Windows x64
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.15-windows-x64-installer



## Setting Up Your Page File and Shadercache


You will need to manually increase your page file as well as increase the size of your shader cache to avoid performance issues, even if you have a monster PC.

To increase your page file, press Windows+R and enter systempropertiesadvanced into it. Under "Performance", click "Settings..." and swap to the Advanced tab. Here you want to click "Change" under virtual memory.

Uncheck "Automatically manage..." and select your fastest SSD in the list of drives. Check "Custom Size" and set Initial Size to 20480 and set Maximum Size to 40000. Now press "Set" and then APPLY before restarting your PC.

Increase the shader cache size via Nvidia Control Panel to at least 10GB. You can skip this if you're using an AMD GPU, this is set up by default for them. If you have it disabled or want to see how to enable it you can go here.

## Setting Up Your Folders

Press Windows+E and locate the Driver you would like to play Skyrim from, for example, "C:" or "D:". Ensure that you have enough space for the list (750+ GB). You want to create four folders on the root of the drive (I.E., C:,D:,E:, ETC).

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\SANDLAND

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\wabbajack

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\ModDownloads

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\Fallout4GAME

If you already have a folder on your PC containing mods from another mod list, such as W.O.D or your own collection, you can use this one instead of "YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\ModDownloads". However, make sure it is easily accessable via Wabbajack by having it placed on the root of the drive.




## Setup your Antivirus
Before you go down the route of "I don't have an antivirus," you do, it's built into Windows. You need to exclude your Wabbajack folder and your Sandland installation folder from your antivirus's real-time protection stuff, as it will likely interfere with your install, and worst case, it can remove files, ruining your install. It can and will interfere while you are playing, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

How do I do this, you ask? Read here on how to do it for windows defender: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-and-threat-protection-in-the-windows-security-app-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e

For other AVs you will need to research yourself.




## Disable Overlays


The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend turning it off to ensure it doesn't interfere in any way. You can do so by heading into Steam, right-clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library, and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".

This includes things like Overwolf, too, as it may cause issues.

Nvidia's overlay should be fine, but if you want to be safe you can also disable it.


## Set game language to English

Wabbajack and the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Skyrim Special Edition in your game library and click Properties > Language > Select English.




## Change Steam's Updating Behavior

If, for some reason, Bethesda decides to release an update for Fallout, everything will probably break. Well, not everything, but something will definitely break until the mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right-clicking on Skyrim in your game library and clicking Properties > Updates > Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it". While you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud as well.




## Start Vanilla Fallout 4

That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start-up, such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu, you can close the game again.

# Please download the Mods manually before downloading the List with Wabbajack. It will speed up the install process.<br><br>YOU NEED THE NSFW MODS even if you don't play the NSFW list, as they are in the same MO2 instance; they are just on separate profiles.

**All the manual mods for download can be found here:** https://github.com/Millionsfrost/N.Y.A-NSFW-Modlist-Skyrim/blob/main/Sandland%20Remake%20NSFW%20Downloads%20and%20Instructions.md

You need to put the manual mods you downloaded into the Sandland Remake Downloads Folder. 



<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bxzPWOk.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bxzPWOk.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

If you haven't already, download and install Wabbajack here: https://www.wabbajack.org/

## On New Game


- When starting a new game, Wait 20-30 seconds (It can take longer, The vault icon in the bottom right corner should be moving) and hit the Enter or the E Key. Then you get to the Char Screen. There is a pop up info box blocking the Loading Screen so it feels like an Infinite Loading Screen but it isnt.

- After you start the game and make your character, it will run all the Mods. That is normal. You only apply the Sandland Remake Preset in the MCM Settings after you leave Vault 111. If you opt to start in the Open World, You cam apply the Sandland Remake Preset in the MCM Settings immediately.

- There will be a lot of pop-ups about level lists. Choose the most Upper Option always. On Gun for Hire, you can decide for yourself if you want Easy Mode or not.

- After you ran MCM Settings Preset for the List, please go into the LIGA mcm and set the drop-down menu for hotkeys to NONE. The Default interferes with Wheeler since that's on G.


## Other Information

- If you enable any of the Options underneath this Post, make sure to ENABLE the Optional MOD first, then DISABLE the Original. This needs to be done so the ESP Plugin stays in the same Slot. Doesn't matter for Nameplates; it doesn't use a Slot.

- **(Normal Option )** We use the CBBE (Nevernude) and CBBE ( Nude ) In the Mod Organizer 2. The List comes with Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nevernude Standard Option ) from the Start, so it's Safe for people who play in their Living Room, or YouTubers and Streamers.

- **( Optional Option )** You can also choose Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nude Optional ) if you don't mind Nudity on " Female " Bodies only. You can also have Nudity on Nevernude, but only if you craft and equip SHOES specifically. You cannot find Shoes in the base game, so you are safe unless you purposely craft shoes and equip them. If you do that, the upper Body gets nude, so you can mix and match outfits better if you are into Screenachery and Similar Styles.

- Persistent Volume Sliders MCM, in this MCM, you should probably adjust the Volume to your liking. Please do so accordingly.

- **( Optional )** Floating Healthbars, aka Nameplates, are Optional since they're extremely immersion-breaking. You can see Enemies already from far away, or if a Battle is happening nearby, you won't be surprised anymore. Play the game without this Mod first to see how much more immersive it feels.

- In the last Separator called Final Outputs, you will find Bodyslide Output **( Naked Bodies )** and Bodyslide Output **( Nevernude )**. Please tick **( Naked Bodies )** if you chose the CBBE Nude Optional Version, or tick Bodyslide Output Nevernude if you chose the CBBE Nevernude Version, which is ticked automatically if you plan to play the List the normal Way.

- **( Important Info for Modded Ammo/Weapons )** In the Game, when you find a Weapon that does not use VANILLA Ammo, equip it if you intent to use it, and then press B. You will choose the Ammo Type that is most similar to the Vanilla Weapon, like if you find .408C, you would choose .308 in the pop-up menu. If you are not sure, I would suggest googling that Ammo to find out what exactly it is. Vanilla AMMO: .308, .38, .44, .45, , 45-70, .50, 5mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 10mm, Shell, 2mmEC, Electron Charge (Fusion Cell), Mini Nuke, Missile, Plasma Cartridge, Fusion Core, Gamma Round, Alien Blaster Round, Cryo Cell, Flamer Fuel, Railway Spike and Harpoon.

The ammo listed above does not need to be changed with the B Button; it is all good. However, if your Gun uses modded ammo, you may want to adjust it for better penetration settings due to improved locational damage.

- Please tweak the Survival Panel MCM only if you are not satisfied with our Setup. We made it way less annoying than Vanilla, and by that I mean it. Only fiddle with it if you want to have Increased Needs.


- SKK Settlement Attack System has a Feature where you can change which Faction can attack you. I turned BOS, Railroad, and Minuteman off because you are not Hostile with them early on. You can turn it on if it happens.

- If you don't like the Speed and want Time to freeze in Buildmode, turn down Speed and Freeze Time in the Workshop Plus MCM.

- Vault 111, right where the Elevator is, is a Sliver chest behind a Fallen Tree. It has the Univeral Workbench Items. Please get them, they will help you with Ammo Crafting, Outfit crafting and accessing Modded Guns/Armors that cannot be found in the World.

- Vault 111 Bugs, Boombug, Forager Ant Feel free to use console kill commands for them. There is no way we can balance this beforehand.
