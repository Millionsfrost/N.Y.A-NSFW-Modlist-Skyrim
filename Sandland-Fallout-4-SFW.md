#### Sandland Modlist: Open Beta Release Version
Welcome to the Open Beta release of Sandland, a comprehensive modlist that transforms every aspect of the game with key mods such as Scourge, True Damage, Badlands 2, and Desperados. This list, built on the Magnum Opus baselist, incorporates a desert theme and utilizes the Reactor ENB for enhanced visuals.

Sandland introduces over 100 new monsters, creatures, and animals, each with unique names, values, and sizes, along with new unique bosses to challenge. You'll also find over 50 new weapons, more than 2,000 new pieces of clothing, and 50+ new armors. The list includes unique replacers and an alias system, adding depth and variety to your encounters.

Character creation is vastly expanded with numerous options for hairstyles, tattoos, colors, overlays, and eye colors. The modlist includes extensive quest expansions like South of the Sea, 3DNPC, CSEP DLC-sized quest mods, and many more. The full Sim Settlements 2 package is also integrated, offering a rich settlement-building experience.

Customize your gameplay with multiple UI options and highly configurable MCM menus. The complete perk overhaul is achieved through LevelUpMenuEx and You Are Exceptional, while gameplay difficulty is enhanced with Scourge. There are numerous settlement mods included, along with companions Heather Casdin and Ellen.

Lootable crates, previously unopenable, now contain balanced loot thanks to a reduced loot patch. The game’s audio has been completely overhauled, as have the gun VFX. FIS + Complex Sorter ensures your inventory stays organized. All vanilla animations are overhauled for an improved third-person experience.

A new laser designator allows you to call in artillery, nukes, and cruise missiles after fulfilling quest requirements. You can also call in CAS support, explained in a lore-friendly manner. The water has been overhauled, and high-poly faces enhance character visuals.

The Vanilla Uniques Framework has been implemented, replacing some unique items with even more unique counterparts. The Grave Digger feature allows you to bury enemies and flatten them, making them disappear entirely, and even build graveyards. The Rebuild Collection AIO lets you restore all settlements to their former glory.

We use the CBBE Reduced (Nevernude) with dismemberment to maintain a balanced and immersive experience. Dive into Sandland and explore the countless improvements and enhancements that make this modlist a unique and engaging experience.




#### Accounts

In terms of accounts you will need: Nexus Account, Premium would be best.

ALSO WARNING: You cant login anymore into Loverslab in the Wabbajack Settings. You have todo it now when the first Loverslab Mod pop up, you need to login over the Windows that pops up. If it works for you first time, good, if not only Login then restart the Install.
So yeah there are like 2 Mods from Loverslab, a Hair mod, and a Physics Mod.


#### Please download the Mods Manually before Downloading the List with Wabbajack. Sometimes you will likely get lots of Errors and Stuff, and if you manually downloads these Things you can avoid some Headaches.

OCBPC Physics : https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18605-ocbpc-for-fallout-4/ 
( Only 1 File to download here, that is the CBBE Version. )

ZGC Hairpack : https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7877-zgc-hairpack/
( Only 1 File to download )

You put the Mods you downloaded into the Sandland Downloads Folder ofc! 


#### Nexus Premium Account

LoversLab Account - for manual downloads through your browser.



#### Installation

I would heavily recommend that you download the LoversLab mods in your browser prior to running Wabbajack. Doing this may be long winded but can prevent a lot of issues from happening. All links to mods hosted on LoversLab can be found above.


#### Preparation

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This package is a must as it is needed by MO2 - you may already have it if you've used MO2 before. If you do not have it, you want to download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019".



#### Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package and the Thing underneath it.

Also get the Thing underneath, i think it was needet for Sexlab+.

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.15-windows-x64-installer



#### Setup your Page File

You should setup a pagefile of at least 20GB - yes, even if you have a million GB of RAM. To setup your pagefile;

Hold down the LEFT Windows key and press R
Type in systempropertiesadvanced in the run box and then press ENTER
Under the "Performance" option, click the "Settings..." button
Switch to the "Advanced" tab
Under "Virtual Memory", click the "Change..." button
Uncheck Automatically manage... if it's checked
Select your fastest SSD in the list of drives
Check "Custom Size"
Set Initial Size to 20480
Set Maximum Size to 40000
Press the "Set" button
Press OK
Press APPLY and then OK
Restart your PC to apply the pagefile setting

AMD USERS: See this link for some manual tweaks that may or may not help.

Open the NVidia Control Panel
Head to Manage 3D Settings
Scroll down in Global Settings to find the Shader Cache Size option
Set the Shader Cache to at least 10GB
Done

#### Setup your Antivirus
Before you go down the route of "I don't have an antivirus" - you do, it's built into Windows. You need to exclude your Wabbajack folder and your Sandland installation folder from your antivirus' real-time protection stuff as it will likely interfere with your install and worst case, it can remove files, ruining your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

How do I do this, you ask? Click here to find out how.

Note: If you're using Webroot or any other free 3rd party antivirus it's likely that adding the folders to exclusions will not be enough and you'll need to disable or uninstall your 3rd party AV as they can incorrectly mark usvfs_proxy_x86.exe, among other files, as a virus, a file needed for Mod Organizer 2 to work. We recommend doing so anyway in case it's a free one, as Windows Defender is likely much better at stopping threats than that is (according to data from av-test.org https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/).



#### Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend you turn it off to be sure that it doesn't interfere in any way and you can do so by heading into Steam, right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".



#### Set game language to English

Wabbajack and the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Skyrim Special Edition in your game library and click Properties > Language > Select English.



#### Change Steam's Updating Behavior

If for some reason Bethesda decide to release an update for Skyrim, everything will probably break. Well, not everything but something will definitely break until mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right clicking on Skyrim in your game library and clicking Properties > Updates > Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it". Whilst you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud too.



#### Start Fallout 4

That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start up jobs such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu you can close the game again.



#### Wabbajack

Installing the list is straight forward, Wabbajack will do most of the heavy lifting for you - you only have to tell it where to put stuff.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like C:\Sandland. Do not install it to one of the protected folders as mentioned earlier. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too - ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location, or if you have multiple Fallout 4 modlists installed, use a common download folder - this will stop you from having to redownload common mods across multiple modlists.

Once you have everything set in Wabbajack, hit GO and let it do its thing. It might take a while as there is a fair bit to download and the speed of this will depend on your internet performance as well as your CPU in the later stages for hashing and unpacking the downloads.



#### Please read very carefully from here on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### If you play the List and press New Game, Wait 20-30 Seconds and hit Enter a couple Times. Then you get to the Char Screen. I know its odd but its the Way it works.

After you start the Game, and made your Character,it will run all the Mods. That is normal. You only apply the Sandland Beta Preset in the MCM Settings, after you leave Vault 111 thank you very much. Dont forget to put Vats Key in Controls ingame on a Key you dont use, so VAFS can be used with Q instead.

Please Check your NACX Settings and verify if they look like in the Screenshot. If not, tweaks like manually like you see on the Screenshot.

#### Survival Mode

I dont know if it works, but it probably will.


#### Vault 111 Bugs aka Monster aka Boombug aka Forager Ant

Feel free to use console kill commands for there. There is no way we can balance this beforehand.


#### Buttons

Outfit System = F4

Quickchange = F2

Screenarcher Menu = F3

Wheel Menu = G

The Outfit System is basicly Transmog, and Quickchange Menu is really nice if you wanna see your Character while changing Clothing on them. 
Screenarcher Menu is needet for Posing and if you wanna change your Bodytype. Its Under Looks BodyMorphs and then Press E and apply some and play around.
Wheel Menu is for quickly changing Weapons or use Items. Also put the Game into Slow Motion.

Reminder: Change the VATS key ingame in Controls, so your VAFS aka Slow Motion gets picked up and is usable.


#### Goals and Issues

The most Glaring Issue atm is LOD. Sometimes its totally fine, but sometimes distant ROCKS/Mountains or Power Lines or Houses are very low Res, if that happens, Save and Reload mostly fixes it. If you have a Solution for this possibily, hit me up in Discord.
Since this is basicly a Desert now, we see way more Stuff that we normally dont see bcs of Tress and all that Stuff, but on the other Side, we get really good FPS bcs less Foliage and Trees.

Now the Things that need to be more tested and Adjusted including Feedback.

- JD`s Weapon Overheating. I love the Mod, fits the Desert, but needs Finetuning.

- Killtips and Sounds. Killtips aka the Symbol in the topleft that shows aka confirms your Kills, can be turned off, some might like it some not.

- Weather from NAC needs tweaking bcs not everything fits.

- Monster Mods in general like Unique Bosses and Mutant Menagerie. See how they are and how they fit. Some Enemies can be spongy but most can be adjusted in the MCM Menu. Make a List when you find out whos way too spongy.

- If you encounter a crash, only report it if you can recreate the crash atleast 3 times in a row. Tell us what Item or Place from what Mod.

- FGEP Scourge Patch not out YET so we waiting on that.

- More Soon.










#### This Step is for Widescreen Users Only

Introduction - Provided by hades (lorehades on Discord)

Hello everyone! This is my very first guide, so if you have any questions that aren't covered here, please feel free to reach out to me.

#### Resolution Setup

Ensure your resolution is properly set in your Fallout 4 .ini file. This is crucial for optimal performance, especially if you're using an ultrawide or super ultrawide monitor.

21x9 and 32x9 Support

When playing Fallout 4 on an ultrawide or super ultrawide monitor, you may notice that native support is less than ideal—it's just stretched. Fortunately, there are two mods available, created by the talented Aignistar, that cater to different monitor ratios:

21:9: Super Ultra Wide Interface (21x9)
32:9: Super Ultra Wide Interface (32x9)
After downloading one of these mods (via Mod Organizer or manual installation), you'll find it comes with a FOmod. While having options is great, I'll guide you on which ones are essential for optimal performance in the wasteland.

#### FOmod Instructions

First Step

Ensure you have the following mods installed:

XDI
Levelup Menuex
Looksmenu
Companion Command Menu Overhaul
Pre-war Binoculars
Second Step

Select all FallUI options and opt for the vanilla Lockpicking menu.

Third Step

For your HUD, choose FallUI; the rest are based on personal preference. Also, enable the Wheel Menu and Baka Fullscreen.

Note: The wheel menu (activated using the G key) may appear offset on most ultrawides. Adjust the X and Y values in the MCM settings to your liking. If needed, I can share my settings, as I use a 5120x1440 32x9 resolution. However, this adjustment is ultimately based on preference. Additionally, be aware that Baka Fullscreen may display pixelated text, especially at higher resolutions. I recommend disabling it via the MCM instead of through Mod Organizer to avoid potential issues.
