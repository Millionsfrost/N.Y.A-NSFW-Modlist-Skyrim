## Accounts

In terms of accounts you will need: Nexus Account, Premium would be best.

ALSO WARNING: You cant login anymore into Loverslab in the Wabbajack Settings. You have todo it now when the first Loverslab Mod pop up, you need to login over the Windows that pops up. If it works for you first time, good, if not only Login then restart the Install.
So yeah there are like 2 Mods from Loverslab a Physics Mod and a Skeleton Mod


## Please download the Mods Manually before Downloading the List with Wabbajack. Sometimes you will likely get lots of Errors and Stuff, and if you manually downloads these Things you can avoid some Headaches.

OCBP Physics : https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/18604-ocbp-for-fallout-4/
( Only 1 File to download here, that is the OCBP-2.2.5-CBBE.zip )

ZeX - ZaZ Extended Skeleton 6.0 : https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/24592-zex-zaz-extended-skeleton/
( Only 1 File to download here and that is ZeX-V6.zip )

You put the Mods you downloaded into the Sandland Remake Downloads Folder ofc! 


## Nexus Premium Account

LoversLab Account - for manual downloads through your browser.



## Installation

I would heavily recommend that you download the LoversLab mods in your browser prior to running Wabbajack. Doing this may be long winded but can prevent a lot of issues from happening. All links to mods hosted on LoversLab can be found above.


## Preparation

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This package is a must as it is needed by MO2 - you may already have it if you've used MO2 before. If you do not have it, you want to download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019".

## Download Visual C++ Redistributable Package and the Thing underneath it.

Also get the Thing underneath, i think it was needet for Sexlab+.

## Setup your Page File

You should setup a pagefile of at least 20GB - yes, even if you have a million GB of RAM. To setup your pagefile;

Hold down the LEFT Windows key and press R
Type in systempropertiesadvanced in the run box and then press ENTER
Under the "Performance" option, click the "Settings..." button
Switch to the "Advanced" tab
Under "Virtual Memory", click the "Change..." button
Uncheck Automatically manage... if it's checked
Select your fastest SSD in the list of drives
Check "Custom Size"
Set Initial Size to 20480
Set Maximum Size to 40000
Press the "Set" button
Press OK
Press APPLY and then OK
Restart your PC to apply the pagefile setting

AMD USERS: See this link for some manual tweaks that may or may not help.

Set the Shader Cache to at least 10GB
Done

## Setup your Antivirus
Before you go down the route of "I don't have an antivirus" - you do, it's built into Windows. You need to exclude your Wabbajack folder and your Sandland installation folder from your antivirus' real-time protection stuff as it will likely interfere with your install and worst case, it can remove files, ruining your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

How do I do this, you ask? Click here to find out how.

Note: If you're using Webroot or any other free 3rd party antivirus it's likely that adding the folders to exclusions will not be enough and you'll need to disable or uninstall your 3rd party AV as they can incorrectly mark usvfs_proxy_x86.exe, among other files, as a virus, a file needed for Mod Organizer 2 to work. We recommend doing so anyway in case it's a free one, as Windows Defender is likely much better at stopping threats than that is (according to data from av-test.org https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/).



## Disable Steam Overlay

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend you turn it off to be sure that it doesn't interfere in any way and you can do so by heading into Steam, right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".



## Set game language to English

Wabbajack and the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Skyrim Special Edition in your game library and click Properties > Language > Select English.



## Change Steam's Updating Behavior

If for some reason Bethesda decide to release an update for Skyrim, everything will probably break. Well, not everything but something will definitely break until mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right clicking on Skyrim in your game library and clicking Properties > Updates > Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it". Whilst you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud too.


## Start Vanilla Fallout 4

That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start up jobs such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu you can close the game again.


## Wabbajack

Installing the list is straight forward, Wabbajack will do most of the heavy lifting for you - you only have to tell it where to put stuff.

Set the installation location to a folder on the root of a drive, something like C:\Sandland Remake. Do not install it to one of the protected folders as mentioned earlier. The download location will have likely been filled in for you too - ensure it matches the directory you set for the installation location, or if you have multiple Fallout 4 modlists installed, use a common download folder - this will stop you from having to redownload common mods across multiple modlists.

Once you have everything set in Wabbajack, hit GO and let it do its thing. It might take a while as there is a fair bit to download and the speed of this will depend on your internet performance as well as your CPU in the later stages for hashing and unpacking the downloads.


## Please read very carefully from here on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


- If you play the List and press New Game, Wait 20-30 Seconds and hit Enter or the E Key. Then you get to the Char Screen. There is a POP Up Info blocking the Loading Screen so it feels like an Infinite Loading Screen but it isnt.

- After you start the Game, and made your Character,it will run all the Mods. That is normal. You only apply the Sandland Remake Preset in the MCM Settings, after you leave Vault 111 thank you very much. If you optinally start in the Open World, you can run it at once.

- There will be alot of Pop Ups about Leveld Lists, choose the most Upper Option always, on Gun for Hire you can decide for yourself if you want Easy Mode or not.

- After you ran MCM Settings Preset for the List, pls go into the LIGA mcm and set the drop down menu for hotkeys to NONE. The Default interferes with Wheeler since thats on G.

# Do not use Beth Pie under any Circumstances. All 3 Inis in the Ini Editor aka in the Profile for the List have Custom Values setup for the ENB, Fixes and CRP. So dont use it at all. Do adjustments manually.



## Information ( READ THIS OR YOU WILL HAVE A BAD TIME )

- If you enable any of the Options underneath this Post, make sure to ENABLE the Optional MOD first, then DISABLE the Original. This needs to be done so the ESP Plugin stays in the same Slot. Doesnt matter for Nameplaytes, it doesne use a Slot.

- ( Normal Option ) We use the CBBE (Nevernude) and CBBE ( Nude ) In the Mod Organizer 2. The List come with Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nevernude Standart Option ) from the Start, so its Safe for people who play in there Living Room, or Youtuber and Streamers.

- ( Optional Option ) You can also choose Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nude Optional ) if you dont mind Nudity on " Female " Bodies only. You can also have Nudity on Nevernude, but only if you craft and equip SHOES specificly. You cannot find Shoes in the Basegame, so you are safe unless you purposely craft shoes and equip them. If you do that, upper Body gets nude, so you can mix and match Outifts better if you are into Screenachery and Stuff.

- Persistent Volume Sliders MCM, in this MCM you should probably adjust the Volume to your liking. Please do so accordingly.

- ( Optional ) Floathing Healthbars aka Nameplates, is Optional since its extremely Immersion Breaking. You can see Enemies already from far away, or if a Battle is happening nearby, you wont be suprised anymore. Play without this Mod first to see how more immersive the Game feels.

- In the last Seperator called Final Outputs, you will find Bodyslide Output ( Naked Bodies ) and Bodyslide Output ( Nevernude ). Please tick ( Naked Bodies ) if you chose the CBBE Nude Optional Version, or tick Bodyslide Output Nevernude if you chose the CBBE Nevernude Version, which is ticked automaticly if you plan to play the List the normal Way.

- ( Important Info for Modded Ammo/Weapons ) In the Game, when you find a Weapon that does not use VANILLA Ammo, equip it if you intent to use it, and then press B, then you will choose the Ammo Type that is most similar to the Vanilla Weapon, like if you find .408C, you would choose .308 in the Pop Up Menu. If you are not sure, i would suggest googling that Ammo to find out what exactly it is. Vanilla AMMO: .308, .38, .44, .45, , 45-70, .50, 5mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 10mm, Shell, 2mmEC, Electron Charge (Fusion Cell), Mini Nuke, Missile, PLasma Cartridge, Fustion Core, Gamma Round, Alien Blaster Round, Cryo Cell, Flamer Fuel, Railway Spike and Harpoon.
The Ammos listed above do not need to be changed with the B Button, they are all good. But if your Gun uses Modded Ammo, you probably wanna adjust it for better Penetration Settings bcs of Better Locational Damage.

- Please tweak the Survival Panel MCM only if you are not satisfied with our Setup. We made it waaaaaaay less annoying then Vanilla, and by that i mean it. Only fiddle with it if you want to have Increased Needs.

- SKK Settlement Attack System has a Feature where you can change which Faction can attack you. I turned BOS, Railroad and Minuteman off bcs you are not Hostile again them early on. You can turn it on if it happens.

- If you dont like the Speed and want Time to freeze in Buildmode, turn down Speed and Freeze Time in the Workshop Plus MCM.

- Vault 111 , right where the Elevator is, is a Sliver chest behind a Fallen Tree. It has the Univeral Workbench Items. Please get them they will help you with Ammo Crafting, Outfit crafting and accessing Modded Guns/Armors that cannot be found in the World.


## Buttons

Quickchange = F3

Screenarcher Menu = F4

Wheel Menu = G

Penetration Setup = B

Liga = H

- Quickchange Menu is really nice if you wanna see your Character while changing Clothing on them. 
- Screenarcher Menu is needet for Posing and if you wanna change your Bodytype. Its Under Looks BodyMorphs and then Press E and apply some and play around.
- Wheel Menu is for quickly changing Weapons or use Items. Also put the Game into Slow Motion.

- Liga is a Menu for Managing Companions. You can also adjust the Liga MCM to your liking, be careful not making them OP tho, Inifnite Ammo is a must have to be ticked on tho.


#### Goals and Issues

Please Test/Cheat all the Weapons. We need reports in the Discord of Weapons that are invisibile, Broken Animations, Crash your Game upon Inspecting or Modifing on the Workbench. ( If you think Weapon is broken, unequip it and reequip it. Helps often )



#### Please read very carefully from here on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#### If you play the List and press New Game, Wait 20-30 Seconds and hit Enter a couple Times. Then you get to the Char Screen. I know its odd but its the Way it works. The Screen might freeze once, u need to wait until the Wheel in the Bottom right moves again, and then hit E or Enter.

After you start the Game, and made your Character,it will run all the Mods. That is normal. You only apply the Sandland Remake Preset in the MCM Settings, after you leave Vault 111 thank you very much. 



#### Survival Mode

I dont know if it works, but it probably will.


#### Vault 111 Bugs aka Monster aka Boombug aka Forager Ant

Feel free to use console kill commands for there. There is no way we can balance this beforehand.


#### Buttons

Outfit System = F4

Quickchange = F2

Screenarcher Menu = F3

Wheel Menu = G

The Outfit System is basicly Transmog, and Quickchange Menu is really nice if you wanna see your Character while changing Clothing on them. 
Screenarcher Menu is needet for Posing and if you wanna change your Bodytype. Its Under Looks BodyMorphs and then Press E and apply some and play around.
Wheel Menu is for quickly changing Weapons or use Items. Also put the Game into Slow Motion.
