## Accounts

In terms of accounts you will need: Nexus Account, Premium would be best as it speeds up the download process but not needed.

Loveslab Account for manual downloads.

<a href="https://i.imgur.com/po13SD9.png"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/po13SD9.png" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages
This package is a must as it is needed by MO2 - you may already have it if you've used MO2 before. If you do not have it, you want to download the x64 version under "Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019".
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

Install .NET 7.0 Desktop Runtime (v7.0.15) - Windows x64
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.15-windows-x64-installer



## Setting Up Your Page File and Shadercache

You will need to manually increase your page file as well as increase the size of your shader cache in order to avoid performance issues, even if you have a monster PC.

To increase your page file, press Windows+R and enter systempropertiesadvanced into it. Under "Performance", click "Settings..." and swap to the Advanced tab. Here you want to click "Change" under virtual memory.

Uncheck "Automatically manage..." and select your fastest SSD in the list of drives. Check "Custom Size" and set Initial Size to 20480 and set Maximum Size to 40000. Now press "Set" and then APPLY before restarting your PC.

Increase the shader cache size via Nvidia Control Panel to at least 10GB. You can skip this if you're using an AMD GPU, this is set up by default for them. If you have it disabled or want to see how to enable it you can go here.

## Setting Up Your Folders

Press Windows+E and locate the Driver you would like to play Skyrim from, for example "C:" or "D:". Ensure that you have enough space for the list (750+ GB). You want to create 4 folders on the root of the drive (Here C:).

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\SANDLAND

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\wabbajack

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\ModDownloads

YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\Fallout4GAME

If you already have a folder on your PC which has mods from another modlist such as W.O.D or your own collection, you can use this one instead of "YOUR_DRIVE_LETTER_HERE:\ModDownloads". However, make sure it is easily accessable via Wabbajack by having it placed on the root of the drive.




## Setup your Antivirus
Before you go down the route of "I don't have an antivirus" - you do, it's built into Windows. You need to exclude your Wabbajack folder and your Sandland installation folder from your antivirus' real-time protection stuff as it will likely interfere with your install and worst case, it can remove files, ruining your install. It can and will interfere whilst you are playing too, causing poor performance and obvious stuttering.

How do I do this, you ask? Read here on how to do it for windows defender: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-and-threat-protection-in-the-windows-security-app-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e

For other AV's you will need to research yourself.




## Disable Overlays

The Steam overlay is known to cause issues when using ENBs. I recommend you turn it off to be sure that it doesn't interfere in any way and you can do so by heading into Steam, right clicking on Fallout 4 in your game library and clicking Properties > General > Deselect "Enable Steam Overlay while in-game".

This includes things like Overwolf too as it may cause issues.

Nvidia's overlay should be fine but if you want to be safe you can disable it too.


## Set game language to English

Wabbajack and the modding tools out there only support English language versions of games. Setting the language to English in Steam will stop issues like Wabbajack file verification failures when installing. As with disabling the overlay, right click on Skyrim Special Edition in your game library and click Properties > Language > Select English.




## Change Steam's Updating Behavior

If for some reason Bethesda decide to release an update for Fallout, everything will probably break. Well, not everything but something will definitely break until mods can be updated to suit. To stop this from happening, you need to tell Steam that you only want to update when you tell it to. You can do this by right clicking on Skyrim in your game library and clicking Properties > Updates > Change Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it". Whilst you're in here, it's also recommended to disable Steam Cloud too.




## Start Vanilla Fallout 4

That's right - start the game. You need to let the game do its initial start up jobs such as creating registry entries and generating default config files. Once you've gotten to the main menu you can close the game again.

## On New Game


- If you play the List and press New Game, Wait 20-30 Seconds and hit Enter or the E Key. Then you get to the Char Screen. There is a POP Up Info blocking the Loading Screen so it feels like an Infinite Loading Screen but it isnt.

- After you start the Game, and made your Character,it will run all the Mods. That is normal. You only apply the Sandland Remake Preset in the MCM Settings, after you leave Vault 111 thank you very much. If you optinally start in the Open World, you can run it at once.

- There will be alot of Pop Ups about Leveld Lists, choose the most Upper Option always, on Gun for Hire you can decide for yourself if you want Easy Mode or not.

- After you ran MCM Settings Preset for the List, pls go into the LIGA mcm and set the drop down menu for hotkeys to NONE. The Default interferes with Wheeler since thats on G.


## Other Information

- If you enable any of the Options underneath this Post, make sure to ENABLE the Optional MOD first, then DISABLE the Original. This needs to be done so the ESP Plugin stays in the same Slot. Doesnt matter for Nameplaytes, it doesne use a Slot.

- ( Normal Option ) We use the CBBE (Nevernude) and CBBE ( Nude ) In the Mod Organizer 2. The List come with Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nevernude Standart Option ) from the Start, so its Safe for people who play in there Living Room, or Youtuber and Streamers.

- ( Optional Option ) You can also choose Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer -CBBE- ( Nude Optional ) if you dont mind Nudity on " Female " Bodies only. You can also have Nudity on Nevernude, but only if you craft and equip SHOES specificly. You cannot find Shoes in the Basegame, so you are safe unless you purposely craft shoes and equip them. If you do that, upper Body gets nude, so you can mix and match Outifts better if you are into Screenachery and Stuff.

- Persistent Volume Sliders MCM, in this MCM you should probably adjust the Volume to your liking. Please do so accordingly.

- ( Optional ) Floathing Healthbars aka Nameplates, is Optional since its extremely Immersion Breaking. You can see Enemies already from far away, or if a Battle is happening nearby, you wont be suprised anymore. Play without this Mod first to see how more immersive the Game feels.

- In the last Seperator called Final Outputs, you will find Bodyslide Output ( Naked Bodies ) and Bodyslide Output ( Nevernude ). Please tick ( Naked Bodies ) if you chose the CBBE Nude Optional Version, or tick Bodyslide Output Nevernude if you chose the CBBE Nevernude Version, which is ticked automaticly if you plan to play the List the normal Way.

- ( Important Info for Modded Ammo/Weapons ) In the Game, when you find a Weapon that does not use VANILLA Ammo, equip it if you intent to use it, and then press B, then you will choose the Ammo Type that is most similar to the Vanilla Weapon, like if you find .408C, you would choose .308 in the Pop Up Menu. If you are not sure, i would suggest googling that Ammo to find out what exactly it is. Vanilla AMMO: .308, .38, .44, .45, , 45-70, .50, 5mm, 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 10mm, Shell, 2mmEC, Electron Charge (Fusion Cell), Mini Nuke, Missile, PLasma Cartridge, Fustion Core, Gamma Round, Alien Blaster Round, Cryo Cell, Flamer Fuel, Railway Spike and Harpoon.
The Ammos listed above do not need to be changed with the B Button, they are all good. But if your Gun uses Modded Ammo, you probably wanna adjust it for better Penetration Settings bcs of Better Locational Damage.

- Please tweak the Survival Panel MCM only if you are not satisfied with our Setup. We made it waaaaaaay less annoying then Vanilla, and by that i mean it. Only fiddle with it if you want to have Increased Needs.

- SKK Settlement Attack System has a Feature where you can change which Faction can attack you. I turned BOS, Railroad and Minuteman off bcs you are not Hostile with them early on. You can turn it on if it happens.

- If you dont like the Speed and want Time to freeze in Buildmode, turn down Speed and Freeze Time in the Workshop Plus MCM.

- Vault 111 , right where the Elevator is, is a Sliver chest behind a Fallen Tree. It has the Univeral Workbench Items. Please get them they will help you with Ammo Crafting, Outfit crafting and accessing Modded Guns/Armors that cannot be found in the World.



#### Vault 111 Bugs aka Monster aka Boombug aka Forager Ant

Feel free to use console kill commands for there. There is no way we can balance this beforehand.
